The lesson has been written by [Damien Irving](https://twitter.com/DrClimate) based on experiences
from teaching generic Software Carpentry workshops at the annual conference of the
Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society (AMOS) for the last four years running.
It has been delivered in full at the AMOS conference in February 2018
and at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in August 2018:
