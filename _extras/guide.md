title: "Instructor Notes"
---

These materials are designed with the core [Carpentries teaching practices](https://carpentries.org/workshops/) in mind.
In particular, all of the episodes involve the instructor live coding
(in a Jupyter notebook, bash shell or text editor, depending on the lesson),
using these online notes as a guide
(it can be a good idea to print a copy of the notes to have next to you while live coding).
For most of the lessons, participants simply watch the live coding
and then get an opportunity to try the new concepts that are introduced by completing the challenges.
The only exception to this format are lessons on version control and GitHub,
where the participants are required to follow along with the instructor,
typing and executing every command as the instructor enters them on the screen.
This is done to reinforce the repetitive "add, commit, push" workflow in git.
